# Task3_
In order to complete the SQL for Data Analysis task 3 in MySQL, I first install MySQL Workbench and download the ClassicModels sample database, an imitative eCommerce company. Once the dataset has been imported into MySQL Workbench, you run a series of SQL commands to analyze data. These include selecting and filtering records with SELECT and WHERE, sorting results with ORDER BY, summarizing and computing aggregates with GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM and AVG. I also join a few tables using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to combine related data, write subqueries to perform more sophisticated filtering, and define views for reusable summaries.
I also optimize performance by creating indexes on columns that are referenced often. In the process, i save all my questions to a.sql file and screenshots of your responses to keep track of the analysis. The assignment develops hands-on SQL skills required for structured data analysis.
